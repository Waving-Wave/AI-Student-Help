This is a program designed to help students study. It allows students to ask a question and it returns a 
(uncopyable) response from the OpenAI Da Vinci text completion AI, done using a private key owned by Elliot Bolter. 
It also features adjustable settings which allow for a user to set how random or long their answer is.
